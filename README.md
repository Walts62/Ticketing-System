<h1>Ticketing System</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
We utilized a self-hosted ticketing software installed on an Ubuntu Virtual Machine as part of our learning process to understand how ticketing systems operate in a real-world environment. This comprehensive system enabled us to create users, manage tickets, assign tickets to appropriate personnel, facilitate incident selection, prioritize tasks, provide comments for updates and resolutions, and track the progression of tickets efficiently. Through hands-on experience with this software, we gained valuable insights into the functionalities and workflows involved in managing and resolving issues within a structured ticketing framework<br />

<h2>Utilities Used</h2> 

- <b>Oracle VirtualBox</b>
- <b>Peppermint</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Ubuntu</b> (23.10)

Within the admin settings, we are able to create team members that can be assigned new tickets<br />

We can simulate real clients creating tickets, for example: John needs help resetting his password
<br />
<br />

Inside this ticket we are able to assign this ticket to a team member, for example, "David" has been assigned to help John reset his password

These tickets can also be assigned the type of incident and the priority of the ticket
